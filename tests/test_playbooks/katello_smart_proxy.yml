# To run recording for this test, you need to:
#   - configure your primary smart proxy to listen to http on 8000
#   - configure your primary smart proxy to trust localhost
#   - restart your primary smart proxy
#   - disable selinux enforcing
#   - record before puppet takes back those changes
#
# Do not do this on a production machine!
