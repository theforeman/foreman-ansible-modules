# Do not do this on a production machine!
#
# To run recording for this test, you need to:
#   - run a smart proxy box (e.g. centos7-foreman-proxy-3.17)
#   - configure /etc/hosts on both machines
#     o foreman.example.com -> main foreman server
#     o foreman-proxy.example.com -> smart proxy
#   - configure your smart proxy to listen to http on 8000
#   - configure your smart proxy to trust anything
#   - restart your smart proxy
#   - disable selinux enforcing
#   - record before puppet takes back those changes
#
# setenforce 0
# foreman-installer --foreman-proxy-http true --foreman-proxy-http-port 8000 --disable-system-checks \
#   --foreman-proxy-trusted-hosts=EMPTY_ARRAY
#
# Do not do this on a production machine!
