## To record cassettes using this playbook (record_hostgroup)
## some puppet classes need to be imported.
## See comments in #582 for details. To import the classes run:
##
## $ puppet module install puppet-prometheus
## $ hammer proxy import-classes --puppet-environment production --name $(hostname -f)
##
## You also need the libvirt compute resource support enabled:
## $ foreman-installer --enable-foreman-compute-libvirt
## And libvirt up and running:
## $ dnf install libvirt
## $ systemctl enable --now libvirtd
## $ usermod -aG libvirt foreman
##
## You also need the proxy to be setup with the DNS feature:
## $ foreman-installer --foreman-proxy-dns true
##
