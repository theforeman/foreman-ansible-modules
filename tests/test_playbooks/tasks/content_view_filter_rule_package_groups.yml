# Create and Delete a filter rule for package groups
# A package group filter is referenced by the name of the package group
# It is not updated - it is created or deleted

# A Filter should support multiple package group rules.
# - create 1st rule. Check to see if it exists.
# - create 2nd rule. Check to see if both exits.
