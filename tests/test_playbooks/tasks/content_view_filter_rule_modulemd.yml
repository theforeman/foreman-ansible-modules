# Create and Delete a filter rule for module stream filter
# A module stream filter rule is referenced a series of elements
# to get to a specific module stream
# This is the general principle using NSVCA 
# name - this can be a list or a single module name. If it is a single module name, you get to use more args. 
#        Otherwise the filter created will filter everything in the filters repos that has that name. 
# stream - using this, we filter to get a list of all the module ids that have the name 
#          and stream matching within the scope of the repos of the filter
# version - adding this should generate a shorter list of ids
# context - adding this should generate a single id
# You may find that depending on the modules made available through the repository, the model does not exactly deliver
# examples are evident in our test repository, where modules have different versions, but the same context
# We are using EPEL8 Modular
# As long as we can filter down to a single entity we are good

# - create 1st rule Check to see if it exists
# - create 2nd rule Check to see if both exits
