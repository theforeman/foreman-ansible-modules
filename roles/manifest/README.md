Example Playbooks
-----------------

Use a Subscription Manifest which has already been downloaded on localhost at `~/manifest.zip`:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - role: theforeman.foreman.manifest
      vars:
        foreman_server_url: https://foreman.example.com
        foreman_username: "admin"
        foreman_password: "changeme"
        foreman_organization: "Default Organization"
        foreman_manifest_path: "~/manifest.zip"
```

Download the Subscription Manifest from the Red Hat Customer Portal to localhost before uploading to Foreman server:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - role: theforeman.foreman.manifest
      vars:
        foreman_server_url: https://foreman.example.com
        foreman_username: "admin"
        foreman_password: "changeme"
        foreman_organization: "Default Organization"
        foreman_manifest_path: "~/manifest.zip"
        foreman_manifest_download: True
        foreman_rhsm_username: "happycustomer"
        foreman_rhsm_password: "$ecur3p4$$w0rd"
        foreman_manifest_uuid: "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
```
